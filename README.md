# Challenge 20 - Supervised Learning

This challenge demonstrates the usage of supervised learning using a logistic regression model from `sklean`.

- The code can be found in [credit_risk_classification.ipynb](credit_risk_classification.ipynb).
- A credit risk analysis report can be found in [report.md](report.md)

The report contains:
- An overview of the analysis
- The process of training the model
- The results
- A summary of the model and results
- A recommendation on the use of the model, including pros and cons
